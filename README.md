I returned to school yesterday. As usual, my anxiety has not decreased or changed because of the beginning of school. On the contrary, my anxiety is increasing day by day. I don't know what to do. Today's typhoon blew very violently, and I didn't feel like I wanted to reduce it at all. Yesterday's visit was really the time when my anxiety exploded. My original goal had been clear about what major to take. Now I have a whole pedagogy, and my life began to be confused again. I don't know which road I should take. No one can point out the direction for me. I'm the only one to go silently, Now it's stormy outside, and my pants have been wet twice. Just now, the intermediary told me that even if I applied for pedagogy, I can't change anything, and I can't apply for a better school. I really feel very uncomfortable and helpless, but it gave me a direction and told me that I can finally learn computer knowledge in good faith. Today, I also saw my roommate learning what I'm learning now. I feel a little uncomfortable. I have an unspeakable feeling that something of my own has been robbed by others. My big goal now is to apply to Leeds University or Sheffield University, one of which can, and then find a job with a monthly salary of 20000 after studying. I don't ask for anything else.
